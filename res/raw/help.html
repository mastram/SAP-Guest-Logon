<h1>Getting Started</h1>
Thankyou for downloading this app. To get started, follow the below simple steps:

<h3>Select Login Type</h3>
You can login to the SAP Guest network using your own SAP User Id and SAP Domain Password, <b>OR</b> by using a temporary user password that can be generated on the SAP corporate portal.<br>
If you want to use your own SAP User Id, select the 1st option (<i>Use SAP Login Credentials</i>), else use the 2nd option (<i>Use external logic credentials</i>)

<h3>Logon Credentials</h3>
Enter your User Id and Password and Save.

<h3>Security Certificates:</h3>
In case a security certificate cannot be verified, the application will not perform the logon.<br>
In case a certificate cannot be verified, please write an email to the developer and inform the developer.

<h3>Generate temporary User Id</h3>
To generate a temporary user id, please logon to SAP corporate portal (quick link: <u>/go/gia</u>) and create a user id for your self.<br>
It is recommended that you set the validity of the user id to highest possible value.
<br><b>Important Note:</b> After the user id is expired, you must create a new one and maintain this in your preferences again.

<h3>Encryption:</h3>
The Logon data is always encrypted and saved in the phones internal memory.<br>
By default, the medium level of encryption is activated. You can activate high level of encryption from extra settings.<br>
If you activate high level of encryption, then the user can select his/her own encryption key. This key is not stored anywhere. This key is known only to the user.<br>
The user must enter this key while logging on to the application.<br>
<b>Important Note:</b> If you forget this key, then you cannot logon. There is no way to revocer this key. In case you cannot remember the key, un-install and install the app again.<br>
<b>Note:</b>When you un-install the app, your logon data is wiped off.

<h3>Automatic Logon:</h3>
You can activate the Auto Logon feature from the extra settings.<br>
If this setting is activated, you do not have to logon manually. The application will logon automatically when you come in SAP Guest Network range.<br>
<b>Note:</b> This feature will not work if you use high level of encryption becuase in this case the user must enter the encryption key manually.
